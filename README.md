# The Odin Project - Landing Page
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
I made the site look like in the task, and added my own additions and modifications.</br></br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** </br>
**CSS (flexbox mostly)**</br>

## Modifications
I made YouTube links to three chesschannels, added images to the blue boxes, added box-shadow and other CSS modifications, modified the text-elements and so on. </br>
This site was made while **studying web-development through The Odin Project**, and it **utilized CSS and HTMl**. </br></br>

## What I learned
I learned a lot about **flexboxes** and how they work. I **learned about how to structure flexbox-elements inside the flexbox and how to structure a website**. 
I also learned **CSS-style commmands** and familirialized myself with old stuff that I had previously learnt too.
